# Algorithms and Data Structures (for Data Science)

* Teacher: [Rossano Venturini](http://pages.di.unipi.it/rossano)
* CFU: 9
* Period: Second semester
* Language: English
* Classroom: [here](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/Mzg4MzQ2ODk2MzQw)
* Lectures schedule: Monday 9-11, Thursday 16-18, and Friday 11-13 ([Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/lookup/f5575mxwil?authuser=1&hs=179)).
* Question time: After lectures or by appointment

## Goals and opportunities

The course introduces basic data structures and algorithmic techniques that allow students to solve computational problems on the most important data types, such as sequences, sets, trees, and graphs.

The lectures will be complemented by an intensive activity in laboratory.
Students will experiment with algorithms and data structures by writing their own implementations or by using third-party libraries.

The goal of the class is to enable students to design and implement efficient algorithms, choosing the most appropriate solutions in their future projects.

### Syllabus

- Introduction and basic definitions: algorithm, problem, instance.

- Computational complexity analysis of algorithms.

- Sorting: Mergesort, Quicksort and Heapsort.

- Searching: Binary Search, Binary Search Tree, Trie, and Hashing.

- Algorithms on Trees: representation and traversals.

- Algorithms on Graphs: representation, traversals, and most important problems.

- External memory model: sorting and searching.
